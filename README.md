This C++ code implements a calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations, namely addition ➕, subtraction ➖ , division ➗ , and multiplication ✖️. 
The program also includes a feature to check whether a given number is even or odd. 

👨‍💻The code consists of two functions - options() and option2() - that work together to provide a dynamic menu of operations. 
The options() function displays the menu and prompts the user to enter their choice, while the option2() function loops through the calculator until the user decides to exit👋. 

The main function calls these two functions to start the program 📝.
Upon starting, the program greets the user and displays a list of available operations. 
The user can then choose the desired operation by entering the corresponding number 🧮. 
Once the user selects an operation, the program prompts them to enter the required inputs, such as two numbers for addition, subtraction, and multiplication, or one number for checking even/odd. 

In summary, this C++ calculator program is a reliable and user-friendly tool for performing basic arithmetic operations and checking the even/odd status of a number. 
With its intuitive interface and accurate calculations, the program is an excellent choice for students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their math skills 👍.
